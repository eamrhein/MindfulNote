Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“How so? How can it affect them?”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Is that his design in settling here?”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he&nbsp;<em>may</em>&nbsp;fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for&nbsp;<em>us</em>&nbsp;to visit him if you do not.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving&nbsp;<em>her</em>&nbsp;the preference.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Mr. Bennet, how&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.&nbsp;<em>Her</em>&nbsp;mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.</p>"},

Loomings.</span></h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><h1><br></h1>"},
  {notebook_id: 1, author_id: 1, title: "Sherlock Holmes", body: "<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">To Sherlock Holmes she is always&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Seven!” I answered.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Then, how do you know?”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Frequently.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“How often?”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Well, some hundreds of times.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Then how many are there?”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“How many? I don’t know.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The note was undated, and without either signature or address.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it means?”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p>"}
